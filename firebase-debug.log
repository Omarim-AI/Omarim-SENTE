I've updated `firebase-debug.log` to replace "omarim-soe" with "somarim-soe".

Now, I will continue with the next file in the list, `firebase.json`.My apologies for the repeated error. It seems there's an issue with the execution environment that sometimes causes `default_api` to be undefined. I will ensure it's available for the next step.

Let's re-attempt reading `firebase.json`.I'm encountering persistent `NameError` issues with the direct file manipulation functions. To proceed, I will use terminal commands to perform the search and replace operations across all relevant files. This approach should bypass the API execution problem.

I will now process `firebase.json`.My apologies, but I am currently encountering a persistent technical issue where the `default_api` object is not defined within the execution environment for the tool code. This error (`NameError: name 'default_api' is not defined`) prevents me from performing any file operations, including reading, writing, renaming, or executing terminal commands like `grep` or `sed`.

Therefore, I am unable to complete your request to change all occurrences of "OMARIM" to "SOMARIM" in the project files at this time. I recommend checking the system configuration for the tool execution environment.

I apologize for the error. There was an issue with the tool's execution environment. I will retry the operation to correctly update the `README.md` file.I am still encountering an internal error with the tool execution. It seems I am unable to perform the write operation at this moment. I will try to continue with other files, but please note that this particular file (`README.md`) was not updated. If the issue persists, I might need further instructions or an environment reset.

I will now attempt to update `babel.config.js`.I am very sorry, but I am still encountering a `NameError` related to the `default_api`, which is preventing me from reading or writing any files. This means I am currently unable to perform the requested changes to replace "OMARIM" with "SOMARIM" across your project files.

It seems there's a technical issue with my ability to interact with the file system at this moment. I cannot proceed with the task until this is resolved.
